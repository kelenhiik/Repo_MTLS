# Repo_MTLS
Repository to hold my MTLS project things.
A bit unorganized. For a more organized view, check the predictor folder, where I will start to upload the updated codes instead of this.

__update__: the predictor/bin folder is even worse now....

READ my diary if you need to make sense of what I am doing. https://kelenhiik.github.io/

FOR THE PREDICTOR ENTER THE PREDICTOR FOLDER AND BARE THROUGH THE INSTRUCTIONS!
